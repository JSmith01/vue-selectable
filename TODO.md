# List of known issues and planned features

* Perform scroll for entire document automatically (works for frame already) - fix needed. 
* Make absBox() results on `selectables[]` and `boundingBox` cacheable (ala autoRefresh: off in
  jQuery Selectable) - add flag `.static` to directive 
* Make selection work with `SHIFT` key modifier.
* Add possibility to require 'full element cover' for selection.
