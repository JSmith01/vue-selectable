# List of known issues and planned features

* Port to Vue.js 2.x
* Every mouse click is hijacked, thus preventing from making usual links/buttons.
  Needs to prevent only selection?
* Make absBox() results on `selectables[]` and `boundingBox` cacheable (ala autoRefresh: off in
  jQuery Selectable) - add flag `.static` to directive 
* Make selection work with `SHIFT` key modifier.
* Add possibility to require 'full element cover' for selection.
